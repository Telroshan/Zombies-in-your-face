## Credits
Would have loved to add a credits section about the graphics assets, but all I could find from 5-6 years ago was a text file containing basically "found this stuff on the internet", sometimes along deadlinks such as [opengameart.com](opengameart.com) or [gmc.yoyogames.com](gmc.yoyogames.com)... Uh. Sorry about that.
